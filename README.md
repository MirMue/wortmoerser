# Wortmoerser

## A markov chain and word generator

### Description

Wortmoerser is a simple Javascript based app for generating names based on a markov chain.

It is inspired by german author Walter Moers, who jumbles existing person's names to create names for his characters, like changing "Edgar Allan Poe" to "Perla la Gadeon". "Wortmoerser" can also be translated to "word mortar".

> "It's like a printed sentence: It consists of nothing but different-looking letters that seem to be randomly mixed up. But you can still read it!"
> _Walter Moers: The Labyrinth of Dreaming Books_

### Instructions

- Download the repository
- Add a name list in form of an array of strings to names.js (the longer the list, the better)
- Open index.html in your browser
- Enjoy!
