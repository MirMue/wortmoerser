# Wortmoerser

## A random name generator

### Description

Wortmoerser is a simple Javascript based app for generating names using a markov chain.

It is inspired by german author Walter Moers, who jumbles existing person's names to create new names for his characters, like changing "Edgar Allan Poe" to "Perla la Gadeon".
"Wortmoerser" can also be fittingly translated to "word mortar".

> "It consists of nothing but different-looking letters that seem to be randomly mixed up. But you can still read it!"
> _Walter Moers: The Labyrinth of Dreaming Books_

- Optional: Add your own names to firstnamesF.js (female) and / or firstnamesM.js (male).
  Make sure not to change the name or format of the arrays in those files.
